<h2 class="center">Twice the power in Europe in even less space shouldn’t add up.</h2>
<h3 class="center">And yet it does at the 120 on Cortenbergh.</h3>

<p class="center">The 120 on Cortenbergh now offers smart offices from 300 sqm with stunning built-in facilities<br />
 - such as a Meetingroom and a private Garden - on "the" Ave de Cortenbergh around the Schuman roundabout – <br />
 the high-street to the European Institutions.</p>
