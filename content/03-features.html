<h2>A ton of advanced technology</h2>
<h3>saving your behind from embarrassing moments</h3>

<p>120 on Cortenbergh tells you that it’s going to rain in 6 minutes, so that you can grab an umbrella before you leave for tea, so you’ll not be ending up bumping into ‘the’ person you’re dying to meet, soaked as a handkerchief. 120 on Cortenbergh also tells you how many bicycles are still available around the corner, saving the trip. So you can do so much more. With so much less.</p>
