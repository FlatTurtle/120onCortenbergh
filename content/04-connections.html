<h2>Easy entrance to a large car park</h2>
<h3>Without traffic violations.</h3>

<p>What makes 120 on Cortenbergh unique is that the entrance to its large car park is designed – by all means – on the right side of the avenue de Cortenbergh. So you will not get lost in side streets,  “finito” with dangerous u-turns or crossing the full white line costing you a leg in police fines.</p>

<h2>No traffic light coming from the airport</h2>
<h3>A fastpass to your international visitors.</h3>

<p>By Airport Express Bus, taxi or by car, the avenue de Cortenbergh plunges out of the adjacent E40 motorway/Reyers tunnel taking you in just 9 minutes from the Brussels International Airport your heart of the EU district. Without any traffic lights.</p>

Since 2008, a multi-modalhub on Brussels Schuman is being created, combining Metro and Trainlines on 3 different levels, to be finalised by a new underground direct train connection to the Brussels Airport in 2015. </p>
